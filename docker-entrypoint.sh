# The use of this script should be temporary.
# The reason is that fail2ban cannot actually be started in foreground mode AND load the configured jail at the same time

# The first post is still relevant.
# With fail2ban evolution, we should be able to to replace this scrip with a CMD or ENTRYPOINT in the Dockerfile
